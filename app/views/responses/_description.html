  <p>After the election, many of us have talked about getting out of our immediate circles to talk to someone who supported the other side. Not to convince, but to understand.</p>
  <p>If this sounds like you, sign up here. We'll try to match you with someone who supported the other candidate and shoot you two an email introducing you to one another. From there, you can find a time to have a phone call, video chat, or even meet in person.</p>
